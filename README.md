## Project Structure

> [!NOTE]
> The project structure is currently under development. Once finalized, a detailed directory tree will be provided here. Check back soon for updates!

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daniel-pompa/next-teslo-shop.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

```bash
cd next-teslo-shop
```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

Rename the provided `.env.template` file to `.env` and configure the necessary environment variables. Update the placeholder values with the appropriate configuration for your local environment, including your database credentials (`DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`).

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure your `.env` file is secure and never committed to version control. It is already included in the `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information.

4. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

5. **Set up the database using Docker:**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

> [!NOTE]
> This command will start the PostgreSQL database. Make sure the environment variables in `.env` match the configuration in `docker-compose.yml`.

6. **Run the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

> [!NOTE]
> The server will typically run on <http://localhost:3000>, but check the output on your terminal to be sure.

Now, you're all set to explore the system!
